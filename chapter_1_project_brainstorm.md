## Cultural Medicine Recipes: Proof of Ownership

Many cultural and natural remedies are passed down from generation to generation, orally and in community. It can be easy to wonder where these medicines have come from, as well as to disrupt the control and rights a community has over their medicine.

With this project the technology would assist to protect the value of cultural medicines and showcase historical ownership within a community.

Example Workflow

1. Medicine workers register their community's history on the contract
2. Cultural medicines are added to the network and given a unique certification
3. Variations and new updates to medicines can be captured on the blockchain to trace the history
